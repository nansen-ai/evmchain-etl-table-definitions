    Queries that reference more than one table can not be used in the "IN" clause as it produced this error in BigQuery:
    > Correlated subqueries that reference other tables are not supported unless they can be de-correlated, such as by transforming them into an efficient JOIN.
    To avoid it we use JOIN instead of the IN clause.
    For backward compatibility we require marking such queries with the comment /* avoid correlated subquery error */
    e.g. see chainlink/AccessControlledOffchainAggregator_event_AnswerUpdated.json
    You need to make sure the query in the contract_address field produces distinct addresses and has a field named address
